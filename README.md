# to-do-list-py
Simple to-do list using Python. I want to use some new tools soon but I will do it as long as I learn it.

I will update it whenever I upgrade it for a better and more useful version.

Objectives:
  Upgrade the code and structure as I am learning
  Change the .txt file for another format
  Make it more user-friendly
  Create a GUI and buttons with it
  Create a website version of it
  Learn Git and improve programming concepts
